üè° Luxury Home Investment Analysis

üìå Project Overview
This project aims to identify and recommend 20 of the most luxurious (i.e., priciest) homes from a set of 100 candidate properties whose sales prices are unknown. The recommendation quality is evaluated based on the number of homes in the predicted list that overlap with the actual top 20 most expensive properties.

The project follows the CRISP-DM (Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining) methodology, which includes six key phases:

Business Understanding - Defining the problem and objectives.
Data Understanding - Exploring and analyzing the dataset.
Data Preparation - Cleaning, transforming, and preprocessing the data.
Modeling - Applying predictive models to estimate home prices.
Evaluation - Assessing model performance.
Deployment - Generating the final recommendation list.

üìä CRISP-DM Implementation
1Ô∏è‚É£ Business Understanding
The goal is to predict the top 20 most expensive homes and recommend them for investment.
The evaluation criterion is how many homes in our predicted list overlap with the actual top 20 homes based on true prices.
2Ô∏è‚É£ Data Understanding
The dataset consists of 100 properties, but their actual prices are unknown.
Features may include property size, location, number of bedrooms/bathrooms, amenities, and other relevant attributes.
3Ô∏è‚É£ Data Preparation
Handling missing values.
Feature engineering and selection.
Data transformation and normalization.
4Ô∏è‚É£ Modeling
Applying Machine Learning models (e.g., Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, XGBoost) to predict home prices.
Evaluating different models to determine the most accurate predictor.
5Ô∏è‚É£ Evaluation
Performance is measured by how many of the predicted top 20 homes match the actual top 20 homes.
Metrics used for evaluation may include Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R¬≤ Score.
6Ô∏è‚É£ Deployment
Generating the final ranked list of the 20 most luxurious homes for investment recommendations.
